The app may also be run by pulling it from the University of Minnesota github, which can be found here:

#    App functions: What are the main functions/actions that the app allows the user to do? Provide brief instructions for how to carry out these main functions.
#    Programming challenges: What were the main programming challenges that you faced in implementing your app?
#    Division of labor: Who was responsible for the different aspects of your project?
#    Future work: If you had time, what additional features would you like to implement in your app?
